# Abstract.
abstract = "The aim of this study was to quantify the regional precipitation patterns of Mauritius using the total mean annual precipitation of 52 meteorological stations for the period 1981–2010. Principal component analysis was first used to determine the significant variables influencing precipitation in Mauritius. A cluster analysis was then applied to group the stations according to the significant variables identified. Finally, a spatial interpolation of precipitation in Mauritius using the kriging with external drift technique was carried out to examine the spatial distribution of precipitation on the island. The principal component analysis results showed that elevation and coastal proximity caused the most variance in the dataset with respect to precipitation. Using the cluster analysis and kriging results, six regions of precipitation were determined: three inland and three coastal regions. A decreasing gradient in precipitation between the southeast and northwest is observed due to the southeast trade winds and the altitudinal difference between the coastal areas and the central plateau. The central plateau represents a distinct precipitation zone which receives the highest precipitation on the island. The windward‐facing south and eastern highlands experience orographic precipitation as a result of adiabatic air expansion and therefore are more humid. On the other hand, the northeast highlands region, together with the north and western coasts which lie in the leeward rain shadow, are notably drier."
