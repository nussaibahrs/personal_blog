I am a paleobiologist (in training) interested in macroecological and macroevolutionary patterns generated through environmental processes across space and time. I mainly work with marine invertebrates using primarily the [Paleobiology Database](https://paleobiodb.org/) and [Neptune Database](http://nsb-mfn-berlin.de/). As part of my Master's thesis, I'm currently working on investigating [origination and range dynamics](#projects). In the future, I am also planning to include machine learning methods in my analyses, to carry out predictions on future dynamics of marine organisms using palaeontological data. I mainly use R in my analyses and am just starting out with Python. 

Originally trained as a physical geographer, I also carry out research on modern climate and natural hazards, focusing on Turkey and Mauritius. In my free time, I also have a dabble with data visualisations.
